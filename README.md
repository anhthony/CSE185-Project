# VarDetect
`VarDetect` is a Python package that detects single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) between 1 or more datasets against a reference genome. It identifies if there are variants at a positions of a region of a chromosome as specified by the user.

# Prerequisites
Python version 3.9 or newer is required for VarDetect. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# Installation
Install VarDetect with the following command. 
```
git clone https://github.com/anhthony/CSE185-Project.git
cd CSE185-Project
```

If you don't have `git`, refer [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

After installing VarDetect, run the following command to install additional required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data Generation
`VarDetect` requires two inputs, the `.mpileup` file and the reference genome of the data in the `.mpileup` file. 
## Mpileup File Generation

****THIS STEP IS OPTIONAL****

Provided with VarDetect is a bash script named `makePileUp.sh` to help convert `.sam`/`.cram` files into a `.mpileup` file. When running it for the first time, run `chmod +x makePileUp.sh` to make it an executable. To run the script, `samtools` is required, installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.htslib.org/download/).

To run the script, the usage is `./makePileUp.sh [.sam OR .cram file] [reference genome] [region]`.

Arguments:\
`[.sam OR .cram file]`:  a `.sam`/`.cram` file. You can also put in a ftp link, i.e `ftp://...` as the file.

`[reference genome]`: a `.fa` reference genome file.

`[region]`: region of the chromosome to look at. The format is `chrNUM:start-end` and the format is 1-indexed. For example, `chr4:10500-11000` means the 10500th nucleotide to the 11000th nucleotide on chromosome 4.

## Reference Genome
The reference genome file can be obtained online by referring to metadata about the `.sam`/`.cram`/`.mpileup` file. Ensure that you select the correct reference genome for the data that you are studying. 
# Usage
```
python varDetect.py --ref-genome [.fa ref-genome file] --mpileup-file [.mpileup file] --output-vcfss [.vcfss file] [OPTIONS]
```

# Usage Options
## Required Arguments 
    
`-r`/`--ref-genome` `[.fa file]`: specify a FASTA-formatted reference genome file. More info here [here](https://zhanggroup.org/FASTA/#:~:text=FASTA%20format%20is%20a%20text,by%20lines%20of%20sequence%20data.).   
`-m`/ `--mpileup-file` `[.mpileup file 1] [.mpileup file 2]...`: `.mpileup` file(s) that contains pileups of reads at a single genomic position. More info [here](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-mpileup.html). Each `.mpileup` file should contain information for only ONE dataset. Multiple `.mpileup` files can be given, but at least one is required.   
`-o`/`--output-vcfss` `[prefix]`: prefix for output `.vcfss` file. All variants will be written to `[prefix]_[filename].vcfss`. If multiple `.mpileup` files are given, `VarDetect` will also output a `[prefix]_shared.vcfss` file that contains variants found in all given `.mpileup` files.

## Optional Arguments
There are also many optional arguments to provide additional specifications towards variant calling:  
   
```--min-coverage```: minimum coverage at a position to make a variant call (default: 8)   
```--min-reads```: minimum supporting reads at a position to call variants (default: 2)  
```--min-avg-qual```: minimum base quality ([Phred score](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/quality_score.html)) of a read to count read (default: 15)     
```--min-var-freq```: specifiy the minimum variant allele frequency threshold (default: 0.01)  
```--min-freq-for-hom```: minimum frequency to call variant a homozygote (default: 0.75)   
```--min-diff-threshold```:  minimum difference threshold between variant allele and reference allele for calling variants (default: 0.05) (i.e. if the difference threshold is 0.05, then if a reference allele has frequency 0.25, the variant allele frequency must be at least 0.30 to be called a variant [difference of at least 0.05]). The difference is calculated as `[var. allele freq.] - [ref. alelle freq.]`.

# Example Usage 

We have provided 2 sample datasets in`testData`. Dataset `NA18555.mpileup` is pulled from [here](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample/NA18555) (alignment data type under 1000 Genomes 30x on GRCh38) and contains the region chr10:10000000-10200000 (200,000 positions). Dataset `HG00145.mpileup` is pulled from [here](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample/HG00145) (alignment data type under 1000 Genomes 30x on GRCh38) and contains the region chr10:9000000-10000000 (1,000,000 positions). Note that hg38.fa, the reference genome fasta file for both datasets, is not provided. Here we use hg38, which can be found on datahub at `/home/your_user/public/genomes/hg38.fa`. You should change the path below to match where you have saved the reference genome locally. We can then perform variant calling one one dataset in the following manner:
```
python varDetect.py -r /data/hg38.fa -o NA18555.VCFss -m /testData/NA18555.mpileup  -o testrun
```
We expect one output file named `testrun_NA18555.VCFss` from running the above command. 

Variant calling can be performed on multiple datasets in the following manner:

```
python varDetect.py -r /data/hg38.fa -o NA18555.VCFss -m /testData/NA18555.mpileup /testData/HG00145.mpileup -o testrun
```

We expect three output files from running the above command: `testrun_NA18555.VCFss`, `testrun_HG00145.VCFss`, `testrun_shared.VCFss`, where `testrun_shared.VCFss` contains variants shared across input datasets. 

If you want to try generating the `.mpileup` file using the bash script, use the `ftp` link found when selecting "Alignment" and "1000 Genomes 30x on GRCh38" [here](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample/NA18555). Copy the ftp link and you can run it as follow:
`./makePileUp.sh ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/run/ERR324/ERR3240150/HG00145.final.cram /data/hg38.fa chr10:10000000-10200000`

If "permission denied" is thrown when trying to run the bash script, run `chmod +x makePileUp.sh` and try again.

# File Formats
```ref_genome.fa```   
   
The reference genome is in FASTA format and it contains the following information:
```
>chr[name]
[chromosome sequence]
```

More information [here](https://zhanggroup.org/FASTA/#:~:text=FASTA%20format%20is%20a%20text,by%20lines%20of%20sequence%20data.).

      
```input.mpileup```   
   
The mpileup file is what ```VarDetect``` takes in to run variant detection on. It is a tab delimited text file that represents the alignment of sequence reads to a reference genome. It contains the following data
```
Chromosome    Position    Ref Base    Coverage    Read Bases    Quality Score
```

More information [here](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-mpileup.html).
    
```output.vcfss```   
    
The `.vcfss` output file is a tab delimited text file that stores the gene sequence variants identified from  ```VarDetect```. It contains the following data:
```
Chromosome    Position    Ref Base    Alternative Base    Quality Score    Genotype
```


The file format is to be a subset of the `.vcf` format. More information about `.vcf` files can be found [here](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf).  
*Quality Score is the average quality score across all reads at that position.  

**In the shared variants .vcfss, the quality score and genotype for all inputs are reported and seperated by a semicolon(;)  
***For "Genotype", "0/1" denotes a heterozygote, "1/1" denotes a non-reference homozygote. "0/0" denotes a reference homozygote but will never be seen since we are only reporting variants.
